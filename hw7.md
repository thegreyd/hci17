Assignment 7: Conceptual design

This is a follow-up to the project ideas you submitted previously.

In this assignment, you are to develop a design for your project. Of course, the interest is mainly the user interface. The application may be a desktop application, a mobile app, a web-based system, a public kiosk-style system, or any other platform, or any combination. Your job (as a team or individual, depending on what you previously submitted) is to specify the application. It should contain the following, at a minimum:

    Who are the intended users
    What must the intended users do
    How to deliver to the intended users (i.e., platform(s))
    How to design for the intended usage
    How to test your design (methods, participants, anticipated analysis)
    How you might iterate based on your test results
    How you might justify your application

Do the following for this assignment.

    (20 points) Describe your design, addressing the questions above. Develop one or more scenarios ('test cases') that include the functionality above, showing how one or more typical users might engage with your system.
    (35 points) Develop a storyboard. This can be as high-or low-fidelity as you like, the point is to get across the functionality above. Describe in words the overall design of your application.
    (45 points) Collect some pilot data. You may use an interview, survey, think-aloud protocol or other technique to capture data from three or more users (who may or may not be the ultimate intended users--right now they are just people who are convenient to use) who are acting as if they are going through the test cases. In other words, each aspect of your design should be evaluated by three different users. Take notes on what happens during your storyboard evaluation. Summarize with improvements to be made.
