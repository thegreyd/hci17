Assignment 6: Basic Laws

1. (20 points) Visit the Cornell Ergonomics Web page for the [Fitts' Law reciprocal tapping task](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLawInstructions.html). Follow the instructions on the page to do the task, using the default parameters of 16, 32, and 64 for widths, 128, 256, and 512 for amplitudes, and 10 for trials. Copy and paste your data into a text file called fitts-1.txt. At the top of the text file, add a single line containing the type of input device you used for the task (e.g., mouse, touchpad, index finger on tablet, etc.)

Participating in an experiment is sometimes one of the best ways to understand a given phenomenon; your grade for this part of the assignment will be based on your behaving like a conventional experiment participant.

2. (20 points) Generate one or more scatter plots of your data, using your understanding of Fitts' Law and your judgment about what is of interest.  Does it give you confidence in Fitts' Law?  Do you notice any anomalies?  If so, can you explain them? Write a paragraph summarizing your observations and any conclusions you can draw.

3. (40 points) Imagine that you're a system developer interested in the time it takes for users to carry out specific actions in your system.  Discuss whether Fitts' Law is known to be applicable and if so how its parameters are determined in practice, in the following situations.  You may need to search the research literature for answers.

- In a GUI on a desktop computer with a mouse, selecting a button in the lower left quadrant of the screen.
- In a GUI on a desktop computer with a mouse, dragging a vertical scrollbar in a window, once the user has executed the mouse down action.
- In a GUI on a desktop computer with a mouse, clicking on a button on the bottom border of the screen.
- On a touch-based ebook reader, used two-handed, swiping with the index finger to go to the next page.
- Shaking a cell phone up and down as a cancellation gesture.
- On a mobile handheld touch device, used one-handed with right hand, selecting a button with the thumb at the upper left part of the screen.
- In a system that supports 3D in-air gesture recognition, bringing the two index fingers together.
- On a mobile handheld touch device, using a one-handed pinch gesture to zoom out of a map display.

Answer questions in parts 2 and 3 in a PDF file called fitts-2.pdf.

4. (20 points) Fitts' is not the only 'law' of HCI. Others include Steering's, Hicks', and even Moore's. Research one other well-known and well-accepted way of measuring people's behavior during a task such as the ones in part 3, and describe how that law also applies to at least three different platforms (desktop, mobile phone, ebook, iPod, etc.).

Answer this question in a PDF file called laws-4.pdf.

Your grade for this part of the assignment will be based on an assessment of your understanding of the applicability of Fitts' and other HCI laws to real-world tasks.

Submit fitts-1.txt, fitts-2.pdf, and laws-4.pdf.
