## Assignment 5: Project ideas

For this assignment you will need to turn in a single text file: <your unity ID>-assignment-5, with the file extension .txt.

You may carry out this assignment individually or in a group of up to four people. Individuals: At the top of your submission file put your name and unity ID. Groups:  At the top of your submission file put the name and unity ID of everyone in your group. A group should choose one representative person for the submission; that submission will count for everyone in the group.
 
This assignment is to come up with a project idea. It should have a title and a description. The description should include the general domain of an application you will build,  the target audience for the application, and what the application will enable users to do. The goal of the project is not simply to build a useful or interesting application; it is also to shed some light on a facet of HCI that is not already well understood by people with some experience in HCI. The project description should also include references to the HCI literature covering related projects, and it should describe what could be learned by analysis of the use of your application. (You will probably need to do some background browsing through the HCI literature to finish this assignment. I usually visit the NCSU library Web site and type "ACM Digital Library" into the search box, then find the CHI proceedings or enter search keywords on the ACM DL site.)
 
Once all assignments have been submitted, I'll make a selection of them public via moodle, so that you can see what possibilities are. You'll be asked at that point to choose one of the projects described, or a variation. You can see a sample of past project descriptions here.

Submission breakdown:

(10 points) Project name.
(20 points) Project team members, with unity IDs.
(20 points) One submission per project team, and no student appearing on multiple projects.
(30 points) Project description, as specified above.
(20 points) Links to relevant literature and explanation of what this project could tell an HCI person.
